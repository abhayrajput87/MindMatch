#jwt and bcrypt
bcrypt is used to just hash the password
***JWT***
jwt is just used for authorization(is making sure that a user sent request to user is still logged in ) and not for authentication(logging a user in(to make sure username and password is correct))
{Normally authorization is done using sessions(sessionId->cookies of the browser->everytime we makes a request to server->session_id sent to the server by cookies->server checks their memory-> if it finds a match->we login)
In sessions, server stored the session_id in server memory
}
In Jwt, instead of cookies it uses JSON web token
In jwt, nothing is stored in the server
JWT_>1.header,2.payload,3.verify signature

We can put anything about the user in jwt
